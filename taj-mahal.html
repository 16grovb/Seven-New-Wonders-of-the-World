            <h2>Taj Mahal</h2> 
            <p>This mausoleum complex in Agra, India, is regarded as one of the world’s 
                most iconic monuments and is perhaps the finest example of Mughal 
                architecture. It was built by Emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628–58) 
                to honor his wife Mumtāz Maḥal (“Chosen One of the Palace”), who 
                died in 1631 giving birth to their 14th child. It took about 22 years 
                and 20,000 workers to construct the complex, which includes an immense 
                garden with a reflecting pool. The mausoleum is made of white marble 
                that features semiprecious stones in geometric and floral patterns. 
                Its majestic central dome is surrounded by four smaller domes. 
                According to some reports, Shah Jahān wished to have his own 
                mausoleum made out of black marble. However, he was deposed by one 
                of his sons before any work began.</p>
