            <h2>Christ the Redeemer</h2>
            <p><b>Christ the Redeemer</b>, a colossal statue of Jesus, stands atop Mount Corcovado 
                in Rio de Janeiro. Its origins date to just after World War I, when some 
                Brazilians feared a “tide of godlessness.” They proposed a statue, which 
                was ultimately designed by Heitor da Silva Costa, Carlos Oswald, and Paul 
                Landowski. Construction began in 1926 and was completed five years later. 
                The resulting monument stands 98 feet (30 meters) tall—not including its 
                base, which is about 26 feet (8 meters) high—and its outstretched arms 
                span 92 feet (28 meters). It is the largest Art Deco sculpture in the 
                world. <b>Christ the Redeemer</b> is made of reinforced concrete and is 
                covered in approximately six million tiles. Somewhat disconcertingly, 
                the statue has often been struck by lightning, and in 2014 the tip of 
                Jesus’s right thumb was damaged during a storm.</p>
