            <h2>The Colosseum</h2>
            <p><b>The Colosseum</b> in Rome was built in the first century by order of the Emperor Vespasian. 
                A feat of engineering, the amphitheater measures 620 by 513 feet (189 by 156 meters) 
                and features a complex system of vaults. It was capable of holding 50,000 spectators, 
                who watched a variety of events. Perhaps most notable were gladiator fights, though 
                men battling animals was also common. In addition, water was sometimes pumped into 
                <b>the Colosseum</b> for mock naval engagements. However, the belief that Christians were 
                martyred there—namely, by being thrown to lions—is debated. According to some 
                estimates, about 500,000 people died in <b>the Colosseum</b>. Additionally, so many 
                animals were captured and then killed there that certain species reportedly became 
                extinct.</p>
