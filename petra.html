            <h2>Petra</h2>
            <p>The ancient city of <b>Petra</b>, Jordan, is located in a remote valley, 
                nestled among sandstone mountains and cliffs. It was purported to 
                be one of the places where Moses struck a rock and water gushed forth. 
                Later the Nabataeans, an Arab tribe, made it their capital, and during 
                this time it flourished, becoming an important trade center, especially 
                for spices. Noted carvers, the Nabataeans chiseled dwellings, temples, 
                and tombs into the sandstone, which changed color with the shifting 
                sun. In addition, they constructed a water system that allowed for 
                lush gardens and farming. At its height, <b>Petra</b> reportedly had a 
                population of 30,000. The city began to decline, however, as trade 
                routes shifted. A major earthquake in 363 CE caused more difficulty, 
                and after another tremor hit in 551, <b>Petra</b> was gradually abandoned. 
                Although rediscovered in 1912, it was largely ignored by archaeologists 
                until the late 20th century, and many questions remain about the city.</p>
