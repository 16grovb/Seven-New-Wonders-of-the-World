            <h2>Machu Piccu</h2>
            <p>This Incan site near Cuzco, Peru, was “discovered” in 1911 by Hiram Bingham, 
                who believed it was Vilcabamba, a secret Incan stronghold used during the 
                16th-century rebellion against Spanish rule. Although that claim was later 
                disproved, the purpose of <b>Machu Picchu</b> has confounded scholars. Bingham 
                believed it was home to the “Virgins of the Sun,” women who lived in 
                convents under a vow of chastity. Others think that it was likely a 
                pilgrimage site, while some believe it was a royal retreat. (One thing 
                it apparently should not be is the site of a beer commercial. In 2000 a 
                crane being used for such an ad fell and cracked a monument.) What is 
                known is that <b>Machu Picchu</b> is one of the few major pre-Columbian ruins 
                found nearly intact. Despite its relative isolation high in the Andes 
                Mountains, it features agricultural terraces, plazas, residential areas, 
                and temples.</p>
